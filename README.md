## Getting & Cleaning Data Course Project

This repo is the solution for the project specified at the following address:
https://class.coursera.org/getdata-035/human_grading/view/courses/975119/assessments/3

### Summary of Files

* run_analysis.R - Main application containing all data transformations
* codeBook.md - Code book that describes data and transformations
* datasets - Folder containing the relevant datafiles

### Code Explanation

The code is contained within a single function call called 'run_analysis()'.  The processing steps are detailed below.

1. Read in the relevant datasets
  a. activity_labels.txt - String descriptions for the activities specified in train and test datasets
  b. features.txt - Column names for the datasets in the train and test datasets
  c. Train and Test data (subject_test.txt, X_test.txt and y_test.txt)
  
2. Merge data for each dataset.  This consistents of assembling the 'test' and 'train' data into a single dataframe and then merging the two datasets into a single dataframe.

3. As per the assignment we then extract the columns from the dataset that contain std or mean for given variable.

4. Appropriate column names are then assigned based on the features.txt

5. Appropriate activity names are substituted for numeric placeholder using activity_labels.txt

6. Factors are specified for the dataframe

7. A new dataset is generated by calculating the average for each variable for a given subject and activity

The dataset is part of the repo and has been renamed.  The script operates on the dataset within this repo.  In order for the code to properly execute please checkout the entire repo.
